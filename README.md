# bitmap_generator_fib
GUI for bitmaps generation for Focused Ion Beam

We present a graphical user interface developed in python that facilitates the generation of
bitmap files for the fabrication of patterns and arrays of different geometries with a Focused
Ion Beam (FIB), taking into account different milling parameters. For 3D structures, a
suitable grayscale can be generated depending on the profile function defined. A second
window will show the cross-section view of the structure. The patterns generated with the
interface can be saved as a 24-bit bitmap file and then imported into the FIB system.
